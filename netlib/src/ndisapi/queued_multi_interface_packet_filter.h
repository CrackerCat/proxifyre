     * Key features:

     * - Batch processing of packets using @ref unsorted_packet_block for efficiency.
     * - Dynamic adapter filtering and runtime reconfiguration.
     * - User-supplied functors for custom packet handling logic.
     * - Automatic resource management and graceful shutdown.
     *
     * Usage:
     *   1. Instantiate with functors for incoming and outgoing packet handling.
     *   2. Start the filter with start_filter().
     *   3. Optionally, filter or unfilter specific adapters at runtime.
